Good for Nothing Platform
================

An embryonic platform to support and amplify the Good for Nothing communities' efforts.

### Basic platform architecture

## Extra useful stuff

#### Mailchimp/Devise integration

User accounts are tied to a Mailchimp subscriber lists. Users can edit their preferences on their profile page. 

Set your API key and list name in `config/mailchimp.yml`

#### Uploader storage

By default the application uses carrierwave and S3 for image storage. You'll need to pop your AWS credential in `config/carrierwave.yml`

#### Facebook Events

Gigs can be published to Facebook as 'Events'.

## Datum factories

#### Wordpress

You can import posts from standard Wordpress eXtended RSS formatted files to the Conversation::Posts and Conversation::Category models using the following rake task:

    rake migrate:wordpress filename

Images referenced in posts will be downloaded and stored locally, image tags will be updated to reference these local files.

Post and category relationships will be maintained.  

#### Bookmarks 

The Netscape Bookmark format, surprisingly, is still rather common (Read it Later, Chrome, Firefox). Use this task to import bookmarks and tags into the Library::Bookmark and Conversation::Tag models.

    rake migrate:bookmarks filename

Bookmark and tag relationships will be maintained.

#### Ning user

Used to import a CSV Ning user list to a NingProfile model and map it to a core Devise User model.

    rake migrate:ning filename

## We're working on it...

This is phase one. See [this post](http://www.goodfornothing.com) for more about how we plan to roll out features and [our staging site](http://staging.goodfornothing.com) to keep up with progress.
