Hello there <%= @user.short_name %>

As you may have noticed, we've started to move across to our new web home. We're rolling it out slowly for a couple of days, keeping quiet on the Twitters and what-not while we hunt down bugs and tidy up a few bits and bobs.

In the mean time, it'd be great to get chapter leaders' accounts reactivated and profiles updated.

Once we're fully up and running you'll all receive some details about how to use the new platform to host gigs, socials, post blogs and such like!

To reactivate your Good for Nothing account follow the link below.

Peace and love
