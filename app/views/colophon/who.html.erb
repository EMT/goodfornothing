		<p>We love the Interweb, but to solve challenges people also need to get together. Hooking up with likeminded folk at a gig or social, or just for a cuppa and a natter is the Good for Nothing way.</p>
		<p>We're hatching local chapters to help good folk do just that. If we're not near you yet and you'd like to bring Good for Nothing to your hood, <a href="mailto:hello@goodfornothing.com">drop us a note</a>, we'd love to talk.</p>
