	<div class="abstract">
		<p>Good for Nothing is a community of thinkers, do-ers, makers and tinkerers applying their skills 
			and energy to accelerate the work of cause led innovators and change makers; it's about diverse 
			groups of people collaborating together, working in new, faster, fun and better ways by supporting ideas 
			and people that are leading the way to what a flourishing 21st century society might look like.</p>
		<p>We're trying to solve challenges collaboratively &ndash; on and offline &ndash; through gigs 
			(24 to 48hr think, hack, do creative collaboration events) and here at our web home.</p>
		<p>There are a number of ways to get involved, but for starters you could get stuck 
			in a <%= link_to "challenge", challenges_path %> or check out our upcoming gigs and 
			socials on the <%= link_to "calendar", calendar_path %>, we'd love to meet you!</p>

			<h3>Doing,<br /> not talking</h3>
			<p>It's not that hard to talk clever and think big; there's an oversupply of that in our 
			world. Too often big thinking doesn't lead to big doing. We look around and see so 
			problems that need innovative solutions. Roll up your sleeves and fail gloriously. 
			Good for Nothing is permission to have a go, get involved, participate and try stuff.</p>

			<h3>Collaborate and experiment</h3>
			<p>These are words we all hear a lot, but true collaboration &ndash; where real diversity and 
				openness is welcomed, where we let go of power and control, where we self 
				organise and allow ideas and energy to emerge more naturally and where we prototype 
				and develop them rapidly &ndash; is hard to come by, we want more of it.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Support the true innovators</h3>
			<p>We give creative energy to the real innovators trying to make positive change happen. 
				Most of the exciting social, environmental and human innovation is happening at the grass-roots. 
				We provide creative support to those pioneers. We think that can help accelerate positive change and impact.</p>
