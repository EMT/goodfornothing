	<h1>How it works</h1>
		
	<div class="abstract">
		<p>Good for Nothing is a community of thinkers, do-ers, makers and tinkerers applying their skills and energy to accelerating the work of cause led innovators and change makers; it's about diverse groups of people collaborating together, working in new, faster, fun and better ways by working with ideas and people that are leading the way to what a flourishing 21st century society might look like.</p>
		<p>We're trying to solve challenges collaboratively &ndash; on and offline &ndash; through gigs (24 to 48hr think, hack, do creative collaboration events) and here at our web home.</p>
		<p>There are loads of ways to get involved &ndash; start by contributing to a <%= link_to "challenge", challenges_path %>, then check out the gig and social <%= link_to "calendar", calendar_path %>, we'd love to meet you.</p>

	<h2>How we like to get stuff done</h2>
	
	<ol class="grid_list">
		<li>
			<h3>Doing, not talking</h3>
			<p>It's not that hard to talk clever and think big and there's an oversupply of that in our world. Too often big thinking doesn't lead to big doing. We look around and see so much that needs doing. Roll up your sleeves and â€˜fail gloriously' as Duke Stump once said. Good for Nothing stands for permission to have a go, get involved, participate and to try stuff.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Collaborate and experiment</h3>
			<p>Words we all hear a lot but true collaboration, where real diversity and openness is welcomed, where we let go of power and control, where we self organise and allow ideas and energy to emerge more naturally and where we prototype and develop them rapidly. We want to do more of that.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Support the true innovators</h3>
			<p>Give creative energy to the real innovators trying to make positive change happen. When we look around for social, environmental and human innovation, a lot of the most exciting stuff is happening at the grass-roots. We provide creative support to those pioneers. We think that can help accelerate positive change and impact.</p>
