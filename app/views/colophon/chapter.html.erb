			<h2>The good for nothing movement is growing through local chapters</h2>
			<p>Networks of smart folk are hatching their own versions in cities around the UK and across our awesome planet.</p>
			<p>Nimble cells of do-ers, blowing up the toxic crumbling system with hi-energy creative collaboration gigs and local experiments.</p>
			<p>All with the learnings, love, support and mentoring from the Good for Nothing mothership. If you're interested in starting a chapter, keep on reading.</p>

				<h3>You'll need a crew</h3>
				<p>You'll need a crew, you won't be able to do this on your own. Two or three buddies is perfect. Good for Nothing is about diversity and lots of flavours. 
				<p>Ideally to start you'll have a design and communications flavour, a coding and tech flavour and a strong dose of social innovation &amp; sustainability within your chapter crew. This mix we find can be explosive.</p>

			<ul id="chapter_flow">
				<li>You'll be Do-ers of some sort, creators, tinkerers</li>
				<li>You'll like ideas</li>
				<li>You'll be well connected in your city</li>
				<li>You'll know how to reach out to different networks</li>
				<li>You'll be ok with 'blagging' stuff &ndash; asking for contributions <br />of space, food, drinks and swag</li>
				<li>You'll like to get things done</li>
				<li>Youâ€™ll also like music (we love 4/4 beats ) parties and having a laugh.</li>

			<h3 class="ir">What am I committing to?<span></span></h3>
			<p>Each new chapter commits to hosting a minimum of 2 gigs each year. (or gives up the chapter)</p>
			<p>These will be 24 to 48 hrs long (these are where the real doing happens and take a bit of organising but are a roller-coasterlearning trip where you meet lots of smart folk).</p>
			<p>On top of this are regular socials, at least 4 a year &ndash; these are simple meet-ups in a cafe, bar or pub organised on the tweets and the Facebook etc where people chat and catch up, dance and drink ale (sometimes).</p>
			<p>We're working on lots of other cool ways for more folk to do Good for Nothing, both offline and using our web hive. So this is just for starters.</p>
