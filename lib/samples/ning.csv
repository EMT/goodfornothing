Find new ways of working that encourage real innovation. Connect like-minded and diverse folk to do stuff i.e. not just thinking and talking, but participating and making. It's an interesting experiment that people can get stuck into and develop together.","Linking what's possible (technology) with what's needed (to make things better). A half-decent network of amazing folk from all sorts of backgrounds. Helping teams work together to get stuff done. Making unusual connections. Interested in open data and the stories it can tell when you start playing with it.",tomfarrand.posterous.com,twitter.com/tomfarrand
